 \doxylink{classAdapter}{Adapter} is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.\hypertarget{md__2home_2sagar_2design__pattern_2structural__design__patterns_2Adapter_2README_autotoc_md12}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Problem}{Problem}}\label{md__2home_2sagar_2design__pattern_2structural__design__patterns_2Adapter_2README_autotoc_md12}
Imagine that you’re creating a stock market monitoring app. The app downloads the stock data from multiple sources in XML format and then displays nice-\/looking charts and diagrams for the user.

At some point, you decide to improve the app by integrating a smart 3rd-\/party analytics library. But there’s a catch\+: the analytics library only works with data in JSON format.

You could change the library to work with XML. However, this might break some existing code that relies on the library. And worse, you might not have access to the library’s source code in the first place, making this approach impossible.\hypertarget{md__2home_2sagar_2design__pattern_2structural__design__patterns_2Adapter_2README_autotoc_md13}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Solution}{Solution}}\label{md__2home_2sagar_2design__pattern_2structural__design__patterns_2Adapter_2README_autotoc_md13}
You can create an adapter. This is a special object that converts the interface of one object so that another object can understand it.

An adapter wraps one of the objects to hide the complexity of conversion happening behind the scenes. The wrapped object isn’t even aware of the adapter. For example, you can wrap an object that operates in meters and kilometers with an adapter that converts all of the data to imperial units such as feet and miles.

To solve the dilemma of incompatible formats, you can create XML-\/to-\/\+JSON adapters for every class of the analytics library that your code works with directly. Then you adjust your code to communicate with the library only via these adapters. When an adapter receives a call, it translates the incoming XML data into a JSON structure and passes the call to the appropriate methods of a wrapped analytics object.
